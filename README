# Mod for Minetest

This mod translates the item description into the language defined in the settings.

Currently supported languages:
de

## Adding a new language

* copy sample_language.lua to your own language
* rename it according to your own language code, in capital letters
* translate :)

## Adding new strings

* First add them - without translation - to sample_language.lua
* Then add them again - translated, this time - to any language you want/can.

This way, other translators would only have to "diff" sample_language.lua to keep track of additions.
